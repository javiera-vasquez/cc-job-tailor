**Example Usage:**

1. **Analyze a job posting and create tailored materials:**

   ```
   @agent-job-tailor Analyze this job posting for Senior AI Engineer at TechCorp:

   [...paste job description | URL | PDF | Markdown file here...]
   ```

2. **Iterate on existing company materials:**
   ```
   /tailor "tech-corp" Which are the top 5 skills to emphasize for this role?
   ```

## Built-in Commands & Agents

**3 specialized AI agents** handle different stages of the workflow (analysis, tailoring, editing). **4 slash commands** give you direct control:

## Why This Exists

**The problem:** Manually customizing resumes is slow and subjective. Which achievements should you highlight? Which skills matter most? You're guessing based on gut feel.

**The solution:** AI agents analyze job postings and extract weighted requirements (React: priority 10, Python: priority 7). Then they use specialty-based scoring to automatically select your most relevant experience. The `/tailor` command lets you collaborate with Claude in real-time to refine the output while watching changes in your browser.

**The result:** Data-driven optimization that takes 60 seconds instead of 2 hours, and actually matches what the job requires.

## PDF Output Examples

You can review the PDF examples generated by the system in the [`public/pdf-examples/`](public/pdf-examples/) directory.

Two professional templates included: **modern** (two-column with accent colors) and **classic** (single-column monochrome). Switch instantly with `/tailor company-name` then ask "Use the classic template".

| File                                                       | Description                                                     | Expected Data                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`resume.pdf`](public/pdf-examples/resume.pdf)             | Example tailored resume for a Senior Frontend Engineer position | [`ResumeSchema`](src/types.ts#L43): name, title, summary, contact details, technical expertise categories, skills array, languages, professional experience, independent projects, education |
| [`cover-letter.pdf`](public/pdf-examples/cover-letter.pdf) | Example personalized cover letter                               | [`CoverLetterSchema`](src/types.ts#L59): company, position, job focus array, primary focus, date, personal info, content with opening/body/signature                                         |

These files demonstrate the default styling using the design tokens system in `src/templates/design-tokens.ts`. Use `/tailor-template-expert` to modify templates and styling.

## How It Works

```
üìù Your Experience (YAML) ‚Üí ü§ñ AI Optimization ‚Üí üìã Auto-Validation ‚Üí üìÑ PDF Export ‚Üí ‚úÖ Ship Resume
```

**Behind the scenes:**

- **Job analysis agent** extracts requirements with priority weights (1-10 scale)
- **Specialty matching** scores your achievements against job focus areas (React, TypeScript, AI, etc.)
- **Content selection** automatically picks the highest-scoring items for each company
- **Validation** ensures schema compliance before PDF generation

### What Gets Generated (Per Company)

Each `resume-data/tailor/[company-name]/` folder contains AI-optimized files:

- **`metadata.yaml`** ‚Äî Job context extracted from the posting (position, top skills, company details)
- **`job_analysis.yaml`** ‚Äî Weighted requirements with skills ranked 1-10, candidate gap analysis, and optimization strategy
- **`resume.yaml`** ‚Äî Tailored content with specialty-matched achievements and prioritized technical expertise
- **`cover_letter.yaml`** ‚Äî Personalized letter emphasizing your alignment with the job's weighted focus areas

**The intelligence:** The system doesn't just template-fill. It uses weighted scoring to select which of your achievements are most relevant for this specific job. React mentioned 5 times in the posting? Your React projects get prioritized. Simple as that.

## Getting Started

You can see the resume generator in action without using any of your own data.

**Prerequisites:**

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) JavaScript runtime
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) for AI-powered resume tailoring

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/javiera-vasquez/claude-code-job-tailor.git && cd claude-code-job-tailor
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Configure environment:**

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    The defaults work fine for most users. Adjust if you need different logging or file watcher behavior.

4.  **Start Claude Code session:**

    ```bash
    claude code
    ```

5.  **Start tailoring your resume:**

    In Claude Code, use the job-tailor agent to analyze job postings:

    ```
    /tailor "tech-corp" Which are the top 5 skills to emphasize for this role?
    ```

This will start the `tailor` experience for a job position at `tech-corp`.

## Using Your Own Data

1.  **Navigate to the data sources:**

    ```bash
    cd resume-data/sources
    ```

2.  **Copy the example files:**
    - `cp cover-letter.example.yaml cover-letter.yaml`
    - `cp professional-experience.example.yaml professional-experience.yaml`
    - `cp resume.example.yaml resume.yaml`

3.  **Edit the new `.yaml` files**
    with your personal information. The system will automatically detect and use your files instead of the examples.

4.  **Validation rules and schema guidance:**
    All data transformation and validation rules are in `resume-data/mapping-rules/`. Claude already knows how to use them.

**Need help migrating your data?**
Claude Code can read your existing resume and help you migrate it to the YAML format!

- Read your current resume (PDF, Word, or text format)
- Extract your experience, skills, and education
- Structure the data according to the validation rules in `resume-data/mapping-rules/`
- Validate your YAML files and fix any schema issues using `bun run generate-data`
- Guide you through the entire migration process

**Example prompt:**

```
Claude, read my resume at ~/Documents/my-resume.pdf and create validated YAML files in resume-data/sources/
```

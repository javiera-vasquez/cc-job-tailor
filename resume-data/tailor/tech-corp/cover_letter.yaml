    opening_line: 'Dear Tech-Corp Hiring Team,'

    body:
      - 'I am writing to express my keen interest in the Senior Frontend Engineer - Web role at Tech-Corp. With a decade of experience focused on creating high-quality, user-centric frontend applications using React and TypeScript, I am thrilled by the prospect of joining your team and contributing to products that serve over 20 million users globally.'
      - 'My expertise in React, TypeScript, and modern UI/UX principles aligns perfectly with the skills you are looking for. At NextGen Solutions, I led a successful migration of a legacy jQuery frontend to a modern React and TypeScript stack, resulting in a 30% performance boost and a more maintainable codebase. I also built a reusable component library that was adopted by three different product teams, demonstrating my ability to create scalable, well-structured applications.'
      - 'What particularly excites me about Tech-Corp is your commitment to building best-in-the-world engineering teams and operating at massive scale across 500 cities in 30 countries. Your modern TypeScript and React core stack, combined with the opportunity to work on diverse products beyond the traditional delivery business, presents exactly the kind of challenging and dynamic environment where I thrive. I am especially drawn to your values of taking ownership beyond the obvious and doing common things uncommonly well.'
      - 'Beyond technical expertise, I am a dedicated team player with a pragmatic and positive attitude. Throughout my career, I have demonstrated the ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams, mentor junior developers, and continuously push myself outside my comfort zone. My full-stack background with Node.js and experience with microservices architecture means I can contribute beyond frontend development if needed, and I am eager to learn and potentially explore backend technologies like Python or Scala.'
      - 'I am fluent in English, Spanish, and German (professional working proficiency), which I believe would be valuable for collaborating with your distributed teams across Stockholm, Berlin, Tallinn, and Helsinki. Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my passion for building beautiful and accessible interfaces, combined with my experience delivering scalable solutions, would make me a valuable asset to Tech-Corp.'

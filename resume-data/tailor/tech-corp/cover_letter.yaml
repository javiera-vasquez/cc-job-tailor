    opening_line: 'Dear Tech-Corp Hiring Team,'
    body:
      - 'I am writing to express my keen interest in the Senior Frontend Engineer - Web role at Tech-Corp. With a decade of experience focused on creating high-quality, user-centric frontend applications using React and TypeScript, I am thrilled by the prospect of joining your team.'
      - 'My expertise in React, TypeScript, and modern UI/UX principles aligns perfectly with your requirements for building scalable web services. At NextGen Solutions, I led a successful migration to a modern React and TypeScript stack, resulting in a 30% performance boost and a more maintainable codebase that now serves thousands of enterprise users. I also built a reusable component library that was adopted by three different product teams, demonstrating my ability to create well-structured frontend applications.'
      - 'What particularly excites me about this role is the opportunity to work on modern React-based products at scale—serving over 20 million users globally across 500 cities in 30 countries. At Innovate AI, I championed the adoption of a design system ensuring UI consistency across all products, and created complex data visualization dashboards with React and D3.js—experience that translates directly to building scalable, user-facing applications in a cross-functional team environment.'
      - 'Beyond technical expertise, I thrive in collaborative environments, having worked with cross-functional teams throughout my career. My international experience and fluency in Spanish, English, and German has strengthened my ability to work with diverse teams. I am pragmatic, curious, and maintain a positive attitude while taking ownership of projects from conception to deployment.'
      - 'Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to bring my React and TypeScript expertise to Tech-Corp and contribute to building exceptional web experiences for your global user base.'

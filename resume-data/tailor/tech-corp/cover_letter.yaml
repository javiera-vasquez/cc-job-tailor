    opening_line: 'Dear Tech-Corp Hiring Team,'

    body:
      - "I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Frontend Engineer - Web, Open Application role. As a Senior Frontend Engineer with over 10 years of experience building scalable, user-facing applications with React and TypeScript, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Tech-Corp's mission of bringing joy, simplicity and earnings to neighborhoods worldwide."
      - "My extensive experience in React and TypeScript aligns perfectly with Tech-Corp's core technology stack. At NextGen Solutions, I led the migration of a legacy frontend to a modern React and TypeScript architecture, achieving a 30% performance improvement and a Lighthouse score of 95. I also built a reusable component library adopted by three product teams, demonstrating my ability to build scalable, well-structured applications that Tech-Corp values."
      - "What particularly excites me about this role is Tech-Corp's scale and international reach - serving over 20 million users across 30 countries. At Innovate AI, I designed and implemented a REST API serving over 1M requests per day and created complex data visualization dashboards with React and D3.jsâ€”experience that translates directly to building robust frontend services for Tech-Corp's global platform."
      - "Beyond technical expertise, I thrive in cross-functional, fast-paced environments, having worked in agile teams throughout my career. My international background and fluency in Spanish, English, and German aligns well with Tech-Corp's global operations and European expansion. As someone passionate about continuous learning and stepping outside comfort zones, I'm eager to potentially explore React Native for your Partner application."
      - 'Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to bring my React and TypeScript expertise to Tech-Corp and contribute to building the delivery platform that connects millions of users with the services they need.'

**SENIOR FRONTEND ENGINEER - WEB, OPEN APPLICATION**

**Location:** Berling, Germany
**Employment Type:** Full-time

**ABOUT TECH-CORP**
At Tech-Corp, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we‚Äôre building the delivery of (almost) everything and you‚Äôll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with our parent company and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Tech-Corp isn‚Äôt always easy, but it‚Äôs definitely exciting. Here you‚Äôll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You‚Äôll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you‚Äôre a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

Tech-Corp is growing, not just in terms of Operating Countries, Partners and Customers but our Engineering teams are scaling too. We are at an an exciting point in our journey, integrating our parent company cousins into a joint eco-system, rolling out several new products away from our ‚Äòdelivery‚Äô business as well as constant improvement and iteration of our core application.
As part of our continued growth and the on-going services provided to over 20 million users globally, we need YOU to join us as we expand our Technical Hubs in Stockholm, Sweden & Tallinn, Estonia.
Build it, Break it, Iterate and Ship it‚Ä¶ Simples

Whilst we have a number of teams internally responsible for different areas of the business, our core tech is shared across the organisation. So, modern Typescript and React are our bread and butter across Tech-Corp, we also use React Native in our Partner application, while a big chunk of the backend is built using Python, Scala, as well as some Kotlin and even C++. We‚Äôre always improving our services and we aim for excellence, so if you would like to be surrounded by like minded people, we certainly have a lot to offer.

If you are an experienced Web Engineer, a true team player and based in Sweden, Finland, Germany or Estonia, then you could be our next colleague!

üìçThese roles can be based in one of our tech hubs in Stockholm, Helsinki, Berlin or Tallinn, or you can work remotely anywhere in Sweden, Estonia or Finland.

**OUR HUMBLE EXPECTATIONS**
*   Minimum of 5 years of solid experience using modern Typescript and React in the frontend and building solid scalable services and well-structured applications using them.
*   If you have some React Native and app development experience (Android or iOS) on your hands - even better, we consider that a plus!
*   You‚Äôre a dedicated person who is pragmatic with a positive attitude, who doesn't shy away from going outside of their comfort zone, and demonstrates curiosity and willingness to keep continuously learning.

**TL;DR** we have many teams looking for FE engineers. So if you have several years of experience in dealing with the front end of the house, can‚Äôt wait to learn new things (for example, tinkering in the backend if you‚Äôre up for it), have an interest in tackling scalability challenges and building some cool stuff, then be sure to drop us a line!

**WHAT WE‚ÄôRE OFFERING TO YOU**
*   Overall our product organization consists of a team of over 500 people at Tech-Corp. We aim to build none other than the best-in-the-world engineering team here.
*   You‚Äôll get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognise that if we don‚Äôt learn, we won‚Äôt stay still but fall behind, and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda‚Äôs greatest achievement.
*   Join us for an exciting journey! The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and our parent company equity. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you‚Äôll own a piece of the pie.
